## Installation

Sample:

* The Server (Server.java) must be hosted locally by one of the players and the port 7077 must be forwarded on the Server's machine.
* The player hosting the Server must provide their IPv4 address to the Client players.
* Hopefully, in the future the Server will be hosted on the cloud. Thank you!

### Build

1. Clone repository from this github page.
2. Download the latest version and setup AdoptJDK in your favourite IDE from https://adoptopenjdk.net/
3. Open the project in your favourite IDE and import the project as a Gradle Project (preferably not in IntelliJ because it sucks!)
4. Change IPv4 address in Client.java (Line 51) to where the Server will be hosted
5. Port forward port 7077 on the machine that will be running Server.java
6. This step is for the player that will be hosting the Server - Run Server.java as a Java Application
7. Run DesktopLauncher.java as a Java Application
8. Create a Room
9. Let other players know to join the newly created room via the "Join Room" Screen. (Click Refresh to fetch the available rooms)
10. Once everyone is in the game, the host will press "Enter" to start the game.
11. Enjoy!
